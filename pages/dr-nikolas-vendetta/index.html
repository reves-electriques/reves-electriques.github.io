<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­­na­­ger of the new Im­­pe­­rial Re­s­­tau­­rant on the Thames Em­­bank­­ment went
in­­to his luxu­­rious pri­­vate of­­fice and shut the door. Ha­­ving done so, he
­­first scrat­­ched his chin re­­flec­­ti­­ve­­ly, and then took a let­­ter from the
­­dra­­wer in which it had re­­po­­sed for more than two months and per­u­sed it
­­ca­­re­­ful­­ly. Though he was not aware of it, this was the thir­­tieth time he
­­had read it since break­­fast that mor­­ning. And yet he was not a whit
­­nea­­rer un­­ders­­tan­­ding it than he had been at the be­­gin­­ning. He tur­­ned it
o­­ver and scru­­ti­­ni­­zed the ba­­ck, where not a si­­gn of wri­­ting was to be
­­seen; he held it up to the win­­dow, as if he might hope to dis­­co­­ver
­­so­­me­­thing from the wa­­ter-­­mark; but there was no­­thing in ei­­ther of the­­se
­­places of a na­­ture cal­­cu­­la­­ted to set his trou­­bled mind at re­s­t. Then he
­­took a ma­­gni­­ficent re­­pea­­ter watch from his waist­­coat po­­cket and glan­­ced
at the dial; the hands stood at half-­­past se­­ven. He im­­me­­dia­­te­­ly threw
the let­­ter on the ta­­ble, and as he did so his an­xie­­ty found re­­lief in
­­word­s.</p> 
 <p>"It's real­ly the most ex­tra­or­di­na­ry af­fair I ever had to do wi­th," he
­re­mar­ked. "And as I've been in the bu­si­ness just three-­and-­thir­ty years
at ele­ven a.m. next Mon­day mor­ning, I ought to know so­me­thing about it.
I on­ly hope I've done right, that's all."</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke, the chief book­kee­per, who had the treble ad­van­tage of being
­tall, pret­ty, and just eight-­and-­twen­ty years of age, en­te­red the room.
She no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the look upon her chief's fa­ce, and her
­cu­rio­si­ty was pro­por­tio­na­te­ly ex­ci­ted.</p> 
 <p>"You seem wor­ried, Mr. Mc­Pher­son," she said ten­der­ly, as she put down
the pa­pers she had brought in for his si­gna­ture.</p> 
 <p>"You have just hit it, Miss O'Sul­li­van," he ans­we­red, pu­shing them
­far­ther on to the table. "I am wor­ried about ma­ny thing­s, but
­par­ti­cu­lar­ly about this let­ter."</p> 
 <p>He han­ded the epistle to her, and she, being de­si­rous of im­pres­sing him
­with her bu­si­ness ca­pa­bi­li­ties, read it with os­ten­ta­tious care. But it
­was no­ti­ceable that when she rea­ched the si­gna­ture she too tur­ned ba­ck
­to the be­gin­ning, and then de­li­be­ra­te­ly read it over again. The ma­na­ger
­ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pie­ce, and rang for the head wai­ter. Ha­ving
­re­lie­ved his fee­lings in this way, he sea­ted him­self again at his
­wri­ting-­ta­ble, put on his glas­ses, and sta­red at his com­pa­nion, whi­le
­wai­ting for her to speak.</p> 
 <p>"It's ve­ry fun­ny," she said. "Ve­ry fun­ny in­deed!"</p> 
 <p>"It's the most ex­tra­or­di­na­ry com­mu­ni­ca­tion I have ever re­cei­ved," he
­re­plied with convic­tion. "You see it is writ­ten from Cuya­ba, Bra­zil. The
­date is three months ago to a day. Now I have ta­ken the trouble to find
out where and what Cuya­ba is."</p> 
 <p>He made this confes­sion with an air of conscious pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne
­so, laid him­self back in his chair, stuck his thumbs in­to the arm­ho­les
of his waist­coat, and loo­ked at his fair su­bor­di­nate for ap­pro­val. Nor
­was he des­ti­ned to be di­sap­poin­ted. He was a ba­che­lor in pos­ses­sion of a
s­nug in­co­me, and she, be­sides being pret­ty, was a la­dy with a keen eye
­to the main chance.</p> 
 <p>"And where  <em>is</em>  Cuya­ba?" she as­ked hum­bly.</p> 
 <p>"Cuya­ba," he re­plied, rol­ling his tongue with consi­de­rable re­lish round
­his un­cons­cious mis­pro­nun­cia­tion of the na­me, "is a town al­most on the
­wes­tern or Bo­li­vian bor­der of Bra­zil. It is of mo­de­rate si­ze, is
­si­tua­ted on the banks of the ri­ver Cuya­ba, and is consi­de­ra­bly connec­ted
­with the fa­mous Bra­zi­lian Dia­mond Field­s."</p> 
 <p>"And does the wri­ter of this let­ter live the­re?"</p> 
 <p>"I can­not say. He writes from there--­that is en­ough for us."</p> 
 <p>"And he or­ders din­ner for four--­he­re, in a pri­vate room over­loo­king the
­ri­ver, three months ahead--­punc­tual­ly at eight o'clo­ck, gives you a list
of the things he wants, and even ar­ranges the de­co­ra­tion of the table.
­Says he has ne­ver seen ei­ther of his three friends be­fo­re; that one of
­them hails from (here she consul­ted the let­ter again) Hang-­chow, ano­ther
­from Bloem­fon­tein, while the third re­si­des, at pre­sent, in En­gland. Ea­ch
one is to present an or­di­na­ry vi­si­ting card with a red dot on it to the
­por­ter in the hall, and to be shown to the room at once. I don't
un­ders­tand it at all."</p> 
 <p>The ma­na­ger pau­sed for a mo­ment, and then said de­li­be­ra­te­ly,--"­Hang-­chow
is in Chi­na, Bloem­fon­tein is in South Afri­ca."</p> 
 <p>"W­hat a won­der­ful man you are, to be sur­e, Mr. Mc­Pher­son! I ne­ver can
 <em>think</em>  how you ma­nage to car­ry so much in your head."</p> 
 <p>There spoke the true wo­man. And it was a move in the right di­rec­tion,
­for the ma­na­ger was sus­cep­tible to her gentle in­fluen­ce, as she had
oc­ca­sion to know.</p> 
 <p>At this junc­ture the head wai­ter ap­pea­red upon the sce­ne, and took up a
­po­si­tion just in­side the door­way, as if he were afraid of in­ju­ring the
­car­pet by co­ming far­ther.</p> 
 <p>"Is No. 22 rea­dy, William­s?"</p> 
 <p>"Quite rea­dy, sir. The wine is on the ice, and co­ok tells me he'll be
­rea­dy to dish punc­tual to the mo­ment."</p> 
 <p>"The let­ter says, 'no elec­tric light; candles with red shades.' Have you
­put on those shades I got this mor­ning?"</p> 
 <p>"Just seen it done this ve­ry mi­nu­te, sir."</p> 
 <p>"And let me see, there was one other thing." He took the let­ter from the
­chief book­kee­per's hand and glan­ced at it. "Ah, yes, a por­ce­lain sau­cer,
and a small jug of new milk upon the man­tel­piece. An ex­tra­or­di­na­ry
­re­quest, but has it been at­ten­ded to?"</p> 
 <p>"I put it there my­self, sir."</p> 
 <p>"W­ho wait?"</p> 
 <p>"Jo­nes, Ed­mund­s, Brooks, and Tom­kins."</p> 
 <p>"Ve­ry good. Then I think that will do. Stay! You had bet­ter tell the
­hall por­ter to look out for three gent­le­men pre­sen­ting plain vi­si­ting
­cards with a lit­tle red spot on them. Let Brooks wait in the hall, and
w­hen they ar­rive tell him to show them straight up to the room."</p> 
 <p>"It shall be do­ne, sir."</p> 
 <p>The head wai­ter left the room, and the ma­na­ger stret­ched him­self in his
­chair, yaw­ned by way of sho­wing his im­por­tan­ce, and then said
­so­lemn­ly,--</p> 
 <p>"I don't be­lieve they'll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
­Ni­ko­la, whoe­ver he may be, won't be able to find fault with my
ar­ran­ge­ments."</p> 
 <p>Then, lea­ving the dus­ty high road of Bu­si­ness, he and his com­pa­nion
­wan­de­red in the sha­dy bridle-­paths of Love--­to the end that when the
­chief book­kee­per re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the
s­trange din­ner par­ty about to take place ups­tairs, and was bu­si­ly
en­ga­ged upon a cal­cu­la­tion as to how she would look in white sa­tin and
o­range blos­som­s, and, that set­tled, fell to won­de­ring whe­ther it was
­true, as Miss Joy­ce, a su­bor­di­na­te, had been heard to de­cla­re, that the
­ma­na­ger had once shown him­self par­tial to a cer­tain wi­dow with re­pu­ted
­sa­vings and a share in an ex­ten­sive egg and dai­ry bu­si­ness.</p> 
 <p>At ten mi­nutes to eight pre­ci­se­ly a han­som drew up at the steps of the
­ho­tel. As soon as it stop­ped, an un­der­si­zed gent­le­man, with a clean
­sha­ven coun­te­nan­ce, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­ra­tion, and bow leg­s, dres­sed in a
­de­ci­ded­ly cle­ri­cal garb, aligh­ted. He paid and di­schar­ged his cab­man,
and then took from his ti­cket po­cket an or­di­na­ry white vi­si­ting card,
w­hich he pre­sen­ted to the gold-­la­ced in­di­vi­dual who had ope­ned the
a­pron. The lat­ter, ha­ving no­ted the red spot, cal­led a wai­ter, and the
­re­ve­rend gent­le­man was im­me­dia­te­ly es­cor­ted ups­tairs.</p> 
 <p>Hard­ly had the at­ten­dant time to re­turn to his sta­tion in the hall,
­be­fore a se­cond cab made its ap­pea­ran­ce, clo­se­ly fol­lo­wed by a third.
Out of the se­cond jum­ped a tall, ac­ti­ve, well-­built man of about thir­ty
years of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­test fa­shion, and
­to conceal it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wore a large In­ver­ness cape of hea­vy
­tex­ture. He al­so in his turn han­ded a white card to the por­ter, and,
­ha­ving done so, pro­cee­ded in­to the hall, fol­lo­wed by the oc­cu­pant of the
­last cab, who had clo­se­ly co­pied his example. This in­di­vi­dual was al­so
in eve­ning dress, but it was of a dif­ferent stamp. It was old-­fa­shio­ned
and had seen much use. The wea­rer, too, was tal­ler than the or­di­na­ry run
of men, while it was no­ti­ceable that his hair was snow-­whi­te, and that
­his face was dee­ply pit­ted with small­pox. Af­ter dis­po­sing of their hats
and coats in an ante-­room, they rea­ched room No. 22, where they found
the gent­le­man in cle­ri­cal cos­tume pa­cing im­pa­tient­ly up and down.</p> 
 <p>Left alo­ne, the tal­lest of the trio, who for want of a bet­ter title we
­may call the Best Dres­sed Man, took out his wat­ch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
it, loo­ked at his com­pa­nions. "Gent­le­men," he said, with a slight
A­me­ri­can ac­cent, "it is three mi­nutes to eight o'clock. My name is
Eas­to­ver!"</p> 
 <p>"I'm glad to hear it, for I'm most un­com­mon­ly hun­gry," said the next
­tal­lest, whom I have al­rea­dy des­cri­bed as being so mar­ked by di­sease.
"­My name is Pren­der­gast!"</p> 
 <p>"We on­ly wait for our friend and host," re­mar­ked the cle­ri­cal gent­le­man,
as if he felt he ought to take a share in the conver­sa­tion, and then, as
an af­ter­thought, he conti­nued, "My name is Bax­ter!"</p> 
 <p>They shook hands all round with mar­ked cor­dia­li­ty, sea­ted them­sel­ves
a­gain, and took it in turns to exa­mine the clock.</p> 
 <p>"Have you ever had the plea­sure of mee­ting our host be­fo­re?" as­ked Mr.
­Bax­ter of Mr. Pren­der­gast.</p> 
 <p>"Ne­ver," re­plied that gent­le­man, with a shake of his head. "Pe­r­haps Mr.
Eas­to­ver has been more for­tu­na­te?"</p> 
 <p>"Not I," was the brief re­join­der. "I've had to do with him off and on
­for lon­ger than I care to re­ckon, but I've ne­ver set eyes on him up to
­date."</p> 
 <p>"And where may he have been the first time you heard from him?"</p> 
 <p>"In Na­sh­vil­le, Ten­nes­see," said Eas­to­ver. "Af­ter that, Ta­hu­pa­pa, New
­Zea­land; af­ter that, Pa­pee­te, in the So­cie­ty Is­land­s; then Pe­kin, Chi­na.
And you?"</p> 
 <p>"First ti­me, Brus­sels; se­cond, Monte Vi­deo; third, Man­da­lay, and then
the Gold Coast, Afri­ca. It's your turn, Mr. Bax­ter."</p> 
 <p>The cler­gy­man glan­ced at the ti­me­piece. It was exact­ly eight o'clock.
"­First ti­me, Ca­bul, Af­gha­nis­tan; se­cond, Ni­j­ni Nov­go­rod, Rus­sia; third,
­Wil­can­nia, Dar­ling Ri­ver, Aus­tra­lia; four­th, Val­pa­rai­so, Chi­li; fif­th,
­Na­ga­sa­ki, Ja­pan."</p> 
 <p>"He is evi­dent­ly a great tra­vel­ler and a most mys­te­rious per­son."</p> 
 <p>"He is more than that," said Eas­to­ver with convic­tion; "he is late for
­din­ner!"</p> 
 <p>Pren­der­gast loo­ked at his watch.</p> 
 <p>"That clock is two mi­nutes fast. Hark, there goes Big Ben! Eight
exact­ly."</p> 
 <p>As he spoke the door was thrown open and a voice an­noun­ced "Dr. Ni­ko­la."</p> 
 <p>The three men sprang to their feet si­mul­ta­neous­ly, with ex­cla­ma­tions of
as­to­nish­ment, as the man they had been dis­cus­sing made his ap­pea­rance.</p> 
 <p>It would take more time than I can spare the sub­ject to give you an
a­de­quate and in­clu­sive des­crip­tion of the per­son who en­te­red the room at
­that mo­ment. In sta­ture he was slight­ly above the or­di­na­ry, his
­shoul­ders were broad, his limbs per­fect­ly sha­ped and plain­ly mus­cu­lar,
­but ve­ry slim. His head, which was ma­gni­fi­cent­ly set upon his shoul­ders,
­was ador­ned with a pro­fu­sion of glos­sy black hair; his face was
­des­ti­tute of beard or mous­ta­che, and was of oval shape and hand­so­me
­moul­ding; while his skin was of a dark olive hue, a co­lour whi­ch
­har­mo­ni­zed well with his pier­cing black eyes and pear­ly teeth. His hand­s
and feet were small, and the grea­test dan­dy must have ad­mit­ted that he
­was ir­re­proa­cha­bly dres­sed, with a neat­ness that bor­de­red on the
­pu­ri­ta­ni­cal. In age he might have been any­thing from eight-­and-­twen­ty to
­for­ty; in rea­li­ty he was thir­ty-­three. He ad­van­ced in­to the room and
­wal­ked with out-­stret­ched hand di­rect­ly across to where Eas­to­ver was
s­tan­ding by the fi­re­place.</p> 
 <p>"Mr. Eas­to­ver, I feel cer­tain," he said, fixing his glit­te­ring eyes upon
the man he ad­dres­sed, and al­lo­wing a cu­rious smile to play upon his
­face.</p> 
 <p>"That is my na­me, Dr. Ni­ko­la," the other ans­we­red with evident sur­prise.
"­But how on earth can you dis­tin­guish me from your other guests?"</p> 
 <p>"Ah! it would sur­prise you if you knew. And Mr. Pren­der­gast, and Mr.
­Bax­ter. This is de­light­ful; I hope I am not late. We had a col­li­sion in
the Chan­nel this mor­ning, and I was al­most afraid I might not be up to
­time. Din­ner seems rea­dy; shall we sit down to it?" They sea­ted
­them­sel­ves, and the meal com­men­ced. The Im­pe­rial Res­tau­rant has ear­ned
an en­viable re­pu­ta­tion for doing things well, and the din­ner that night
­did not in any way de­tract from its lustre. But, de­light­ful as it all
­was, it was no­ti­ceable that the three guests paid more at­ten­tion to
­their host than to his ex­cellent  <em>me­nu</em>. As they had said be­fore his
ar­ri­val, they had all had dea­lings with him for se­ve­ral years, but what
­those dea­lings were they were ca­re­ful not to des­cribe. It was more than
­pos­sible that they hard­ly li­ked to re­mem­ber them them­selves.</p> 
 <p>When cof­fee had been ser­ved and the ser­vants had wi­th­drawn, Dr. Ni­ko­la
­rose from the ta­ble, and went across to the mas­sive si­de­board. On it
s­tood a bas­ket of ve­ry cu­rious shape and work­man­ship. This he ope­ned,
and as he did so, to the as­to­nish­ment of his guests, an en­or­mous cat, as
­black as his mas­ter's coat, lea­ped out on to the floor. The rea­son for
the sau­cer and jug of milk be­came evident.</p> 
 <p>Sea­ting him­self at the table again, the host fol­lo­wed the example of his
­guests and lit a ci­gar, blo­wing a cloud of smoke luxu­rious­ly through his
­de­li­ca­te­ly chi­sel­led nos­trils. His eyes wan­de­red round the cor­nice of
the room, took in the pic­tures and de­co­ra­tions, and then came down to
­meet the faces of his com­pa­nions. As they did so, the black cat, ha­ving
­fi­ni­shed its meal, sprang on to his shoul­der to crouch the­re, wat­ching
the three men through the cur­ling smoke drift with its green blin­king,
­fien­dish eyes. Dr. Ni­ko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal had
u­pon his guests.</p> 
 <p>"Now shall we get to bu­si­ness?" he said brisk­ly.</p> 
 <p>The others al­most si­mul­ta­neous­ly kno­cked the ashes off their ci­gars and
­brought them­selves to at­ten­tion. Dr. Ni­ko­la's dain­ty, lan­guid man­ner
­see­med to drop from him like a cloak, his eyes brigh­te­ned, and his
­voi­ce, when he spo­ke, was clean cut as chi­sel­led sil­ver.</p> 
 <p>"You are doubt­less an­xious to be in­for­med why I sum­mo­ned you from all
­parts of the globe to meet me here to-­night? And it is ve­ry na­tu­ral you
­should be. But then, from what you know of me, you should not be
­sur­pri­sed at any­thing I do."</p> 
 <p>His voice drop­ped back in­to its old tone of gentle lan­guor. He drew in a
­great breath of smoke and then sent it slow­ly out from his lips again.
­His eyes were half clo­sed, and he drum­med with one fin­ger on the ta­ble
edge. The cat loo­ked through the smoke at the three men, and it see­med
­to them that he grew eve­ry mo­ment lar­ger and more fe­ro­cious. Pre­sent­ly
­his ow­ner took him from his per­ch, and sea­ting him on his knee fell to
s­tro­king his fur, from head to tail, with his long slim fin­gers. It was
as if he were dra­wing ins­pi­ra­tion for some dead­ly mi­schief from the
un­can­ny beast.</p> 
 <p>"To pre­face what I have to say to you, let me tell you that this is by
­far the most im­por­tant bu­si­ness for which I have ever re­qui­red your
­help. (Three slow strokes down the centre of the ba­ck, and one round
each ear.) When it first came in­to my mind I was at a loss who to trust
in the mat­ter. I thought of Ven­don, but I found Ven­don was dead. I
­thought of Brown­low, but Brown­low was no lon­ger fai­th­ful. (T­wo stro­kes
­down the back and two on the throat.) Then bit by bit I re­mem­be­red you.
I was in Bra­zil at the time. So I sent for you. You came. So far so
­good."</p> 
 <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fi­re­place. As he went the cat craw­led
­back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­tion on his shoul­der. Then his voice chan­ged
once more to its for­mer bu­si­ness-­like tone.</p> 
 <p>"I am not going to tell you ve­ry much about it. But from what I do tell
you, you will be able to ga­ther a great deal and ima­gine the res­t. To
­be­gin wi­th, there is a man li­ving in this world to-­day who has done me a
­great and las­ting in­ju­ry. What that in­ju­ry is is no concern of yours.
You would not un­ders­tand if I told you. So we'll leave that out of the
­ques­tion. He is im­men­se­ly rich. His cheque for £300,000 would be
­ho­nou­red by his bank at any mi­nute. Ob­vious­ly he is a po­wer. He has had
­rea­son to know that I am pit­ting my wits against his, and he flat­ters
­him­self that so far he has got the bet­ter of me. That is be­cause I am
­dra­wing him on. I am ma­tu­ring a plan which will make him a poor and a
­ve­ry mi­se­rable man at one and the same time. If that scheme suc­ceed­s,
and I am sa­tis­fied with the way you three men have per­for­med the parts I
­shall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to each of you the sum of
£10,000. If it doesn't suc­ceed, then you will each re­ceive a thou­sand
and your ex­penses. Do you fol­low me?"</p> 
 <p>It was evident from their faces that they hung upon his eve­ry word.</p> 
 <p>"But, re­mem­ber, I de­mand from you your whole and en­tire la­bour. Whi­le
you are ser­ving me you are mine bo­dy and soul. I know you are
­trust­wor­thy. I have had good proof that you are--­par­don the
ex­pres­sion--­uns­cru­pu­lous, and I flat­ter my­self you are silent. What is
­mo­re, I shall tell you no­thing beyond what is ne­ces­sa­ry for the car­rying
out of my sche­me, so that you could not be­tray me if you would. Now for
­my plans!"</p> 
 <p>He sat down again and took a pa­per from his po­cket. Ha­ving per­used it,
he tur­ned to Eas­to­ver.</p> 
 <p>"You will leave at once--­that is to say, by the boat on Wed­nes­day--­for
­Syd­ney. You will book your pas­sage to-­mor­row mor­ning, first thing, and
­join her in Ply­mouth. You will meet me to-­mor­row eve­ning at an ad­dress I
­will send you, and re­ceive your fi­nal ins­truc­tions. Good-­night."</p> 
 <p>Seeing that he was ex­pec­ted to go, Eas­to­ver ro­se, shook hand­s, and left
the room wi­thout a word. He was too as­to­ni­shed to he­si­tate or to say
a­ny­thing.</p> 
 <p>Ni­ko­la took ano­ther let­ter from his po­cket and tur­ned to Pren­der­gast.
"<em>You</em>  will go down to Do­ver to-­night, cross to Pa­ris to-­mor­row mor­ning,
and leave this let­ter per­so­nal­ly at the ad­dress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thurs­day, at half-­past two pre­ci­se­ly, you will de­li­ver me an
ans­wer in the porch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find suf­fi­cient mo­ney in
­that en­ve­lope to pay all your ex­penses. Now go!"</p> 
 <p>"At half-­past two you shall have your ans­wer. Good-­night."</p> 
 <p>"Good-­night."</p> 
 <p>When Pren­der­gast had left the room, Dr. Ni­ko­la lit ano­ther ci­gar and
­tur­ned his at­ten­tions to Mr. Bax­ter.</p> 
 <p>"Six months ago, Mr. Bax­ter, I found for you a si­tua­tion as tu­tor to the
young Mar­quis of Be­cken­ham. You still hold it, I sup­po­se?"</p> 
 <p>"I do."</p> 
 <p>"Is the fa­ther well dis­po­sed to­wards you?"</p> 
 <p>"In eve­ry way. I have done my best to in­gra­tiate my­self with him. That
­was one of your ins­truc­tions."</p> 
 <p>"Yes, yes! But I was not cer­tain that you would suc­ceed. If the old man
is any­thing like what he was when I last met him he must still be a
­dif­fi­cult per­son to deal with. Does the boy like you?"</p> 
 <p>"I hope so."</p> 
 <p>"Have you brought me his pho­to­graph as I di­rec­ted?"</p> 
 <p>"I have. Here it is."</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter took a pho­to­graph from his po­cket and han­ded it across the table.</p> 
 <p>"Good. You have done ve­ry well, Mr. Bax­ter. I am plea­sed with you.
­To-­mor­row mor­ning you will go back to York­shire----"</p> 
 <p>"I beg your par­don, Bour­ne­mouth. His Grace owns a house near
­Bour­ne­mou­th, which he oc­cu­pies du­ring the sum­mer months."</p> 
 <p>"Ve­ry well--­then to-­mor­row mor­ning you will go back to Bour­ne­mouth and
­con­ti­nue to in­gra­tiate your­self with fa­ther and son. You will al­so be­gin
­to im­plant in the boy's mind a de­sire for tra­vel. Don't let him be­co­me
a­ware that his de­sire has its source in you--­but do not fail to fos­ter
it all you can. I will com­mu­ni­cate with you fur­ther in a day or two. Now
­go."</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter in his turn left the room. The door clo­sed. Dr. Ni­ko­la pi­cked up
the pho­to­graph and stu­died it.</p> 
 <p>"The li­ke­ness is un­mis­ta­kable--­or it ought to be. My friend, my ve­ry
­dear friend, We­the­rell, my toils are clo­sing on you. My ar­ran­ge­ments are
­per­fec­ting them­selves ad­mi­ra­bly. Pre­sent­ly, when all is com­ple­te, I
­shall press the le­ver, the ma­chi­ne­ry will be set in mo­tion, and you will
­find your­self being slow­ly but sur­ely ground in­to pow­der. Then you will
­hand over what I want, and be sor­ry you thought fit to baulk Dr.
­Ni­ko­la!"</p> 
 <p>He rang the bell and or­de­red his bill. This du­ty di­schar­ged, he pla­ced
the cat back in its pri­son, shut the lid, des­cen­ded with the bas­ket to
the hall, and cal­led a han­som. The por­ter in­qui­red to what ad­dress he
­should or­der the cab­man to drive. Dr. Ni­ko­la did not re­ply for a mo­ment,
­then he said, as if he had been thin­king so­me­thing out: "The  <em>Green
­Sai­lor</em>  pu­blic-­hou­se, East In­dia Dock Road."</p>
